Hello, 
I'll be happy to share my expertise in this field! 
As an English Teacher I had to make hundreds of interactive powerpoint presentations for my students, 
and continues to do so. 
Traditional powerpoint presentations with lots of text and generic photos don't make the cut anymore. 
A beautiful PP with a refreshing design and attractive colours will definetly keep learners interested and engaged.
